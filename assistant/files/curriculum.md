# Summary

Hydroponics, in its simplest form, is growing plants by supplying all necessary nutrients in the plants’ water supply rather than through the soil. The word derives from the Greek root words “hydro,” meaning water, and “ponics,” meaning working. Growing plants hydroponically helps gardeners and farmers grow more food in smaller areas (classrooms, greenhouses, rooftops, and living rooms, for instance) and to produce food in parts of the world where space, good soil, and/or water are limited.

When students grow plants hydroponically, they begin to investigate plant needs through a different lens and have the chance to develop a deep understanding about the conditions required for healthy plant growth and development. Hydroponic gardening also offers the opportunity to explore foundational engineering and design principles. Guiding questions emerge such as: How can we provide support for plants without soil? How do plants grown with just water and nutrients compare with plants grown in soil? How can we get the tallest plants using a hydroponics setup? These questions lead to experimentation and problem-solving in the classroom. Recordkeeping becomes a natural outgrowth of these endeavors. Concepts related to basic plant parts and needs, nutrition, food production, recycling, agricultural technology, and other areas come to life in these soilless growing environments. These studies may even lead to classroom business opportunities or fuel student career interests.

Additional benefits can be realized when edible crops are grown and students experience the joy and excitement of sampling the fruits of their labor! Edible gardening, along with food and agriculture education and local procurement, is one of the core elements of farm to school which enriches the connection students and communities have with fresh, healthful food and local food producers. Lessons in this guide help support integration of these core elements into the classroom and school community

# Lesson 1: Hydroponics 101

## Introduction
**Lesson Summary:**  
Hydroponics is a form of agriculture where plants are grown without soil, nourished instead by mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. This method allows for precise nutrient management and faster growth rates than traditional agriculture. It is especially useful in areas where the land is non-arable or space is limited, such as urban environments or deserts. This lesson introduces the principles of hydroponics, its environmental advantages, and its role in modern agriculture.

**Learning Outcomes:**  
Students will learn the basic concepts and benefits of hydroponic systems. They will understand how these systems maximize space and conserve water, making them ideal for urban farming and sustainable agriculture practices. By the end of the lesson, students should be able to explain how hydroponics can be a solution to global food production challenges and describe different types of hydroponic systems.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What is hydroponics and how does it differ from traditional soil-based gardening?
- What are the potential benefits of using hydroponic systems for plant growth?
- How can hydroponic systems be applied in different environmental conditions?

## Background Information
Hydroponics has historical roots dating back to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the floating gardens of the Aztecs, where natural nutrient-rich water sources were used to grow plants. The modern science of hydroponics began in the 17th century with experiments on plant cultivation in water without soil. These studies laid the groundwork for understanding the nutrient uptake in plants and led to the development of various hydroponic techniques that are used today.

The science behind hydroponics involves a balanced, nutrient-rich solution that plants absorb more efficiently than soil, allowing for better growth control and higher yields. Key elements include the type of hydroponic system, such as wick, deep water culture, or nutrient film technique, each suitable for different types of plants and environments. This section discusses the advantages of hydroponics, including less use of water and fertilizers, reduced risk of diseases, and the ability to create farms in urban settings where space is limited.

## Exploration
During this session, students will engage in creating their own small-scale hydroponic system to understand the mechanics and requirements of a functional hydroponic farm. They will experiment with different nutrient solutions and observe the effects on plant growth. This practical application helps reinforce the theory discussed in class by allowing students to directly manipulate and monitor their hydroponic systems.

Students will follow detailed steps to set up their systems, starting with the selection of an appropriate container, choosing a growing medium, and preparing a nutrient solution. They will learn to measure pH and nutrient levels, essential skills for maintaining a successful hydroponic system. The exploration aims to cultivate analytical skills and a hands-on understanding of how different variables affect plant health in a hydroponic environment.

## Discussion
