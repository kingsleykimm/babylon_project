Safety Reminders
Safety first! Please keep the following in mind when using your Micro-Farm:
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
3
1. Authorized personnel only. Allow only trained, authorized personnel to have
farm access. This will help ensure food safety protocols are followed. Do not allow children to
access the farm without supervision.
2. Do not move the farm. Moving your farm could damage it and present a safety risk,
so contact Babylon if you ever need to move your farm – even if only a few inches.
3. Keep farm locked. Both the doors of the growing area and the bottom reservoir
should remain locked when not in use by authorized personnel to avoid tampering by
unauthorized individuals.
4. Follow food safety regulations. Wear gloves when handling crops, wash
produce before serving, and follow all local food safety regulations and guidelines.
5. Use caution when handling nutrient and pH balancing
solutions. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Rinse skin and eyes with cold water
immediately if exposed to any of the solutions. Seek medical help if solutions are swallowed.
6. Use a ladder when accessing upper zones of the farm. Be sure to
keep one hand on the farm at all times to avoid falling or slipping.
7. Do not tamper with electrical components. Only Babylon-authorized
technicians should service these components.

There are five zones in your Micro-Farm. Zone 5 is dedicated to germinating seed packs and growing
microgreens only.
Each of the five zones in your Micro-Farm contains four GrowServe trays that can be removed from the
farm for transplanting, harvesting, and cleaning. Each GrowServe tray contains 14 plant sites. This
means your Micro-Farm can grow up to 224 plants in addition to microgreens and germination in Zone
5.

How To Plant
Check out our tutorial video on how to plant your new seeds on the Learn tab of the app or by
scanning the QR code below:
As always, itʼs important to wear disposable gloves when working in the farm and wash your hands
beforehand.
This process will take less than five minutes.
Hereʼs how to plant:
1
Get your plant pack. Babylon will send these to you on a regular basis.
2
Gear up. Put on a pair of disposable gloves and grab your sanitized pair of scissors.
3
Open the pack. Carefully cut open the pack and slide out the tray containing the growth
medium. Make sure the pack is right side up, with the seed holes and label facing you, so the
seeds donʼt fall out.
4
Place the pack and crop tag in the farm. Carefully place the pack in a GrowServe tray in Zone
5, then insert the crop tag in the slot in front of the tray.
5
Spray the seeds heavily with water. Use your Water Only spray bottle to heavily mist the
seeds and top of the growth medium. The wetter the seeds and top of the growth medium, the
better. Just be careful not to spray too hard–you donʼt want the seeds to come out of the
growth medium.
6
Cover the plant pack with a humidity dome. Place a clear plastic humidity dome on top of
the GrowServe tray to cover the newly planted seeds. Youʼll remove the humidity dome aȦer
about a week, when the seeds have begun to sprout.
7
Scan the crop into the app. Open the Guided Growing app on your phone. From the home
screen, tap Scan Tag, then scan the QR on the crop tag as prompted and select Zone 5.
Thatʼs it! The app will tell you when itʼs time to transplant your seedlings.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
12
GROWER TIP: Note that if you donʼt Plant the crop through the app when you physically place
the new seeds in your farm, the app will not tell you when to transplant, harvest, or clean.
Scanning crops into the app is how you receive more seeds.
How To Plant Microgreens
Check out our tutorial video on how to plant microgreens on the Learn tab of the app or by
scanning the QR code below:
As always, itʼs important to wear disposable gloves when working in the farm and wash your hands
beforehand.
This process will take less than 5 minutes.
Hereʼs how to plant microgreens:
1
Get the growth medium and seeds.
2
Gear up. Wash up and put on a pair of disposable gloves.
3
Place the microgreen insert in a tray in the germination zone. The insert supports the
growth medium to the proper level so the seeds donʼt wash away. It looks like this:
Once in the farm, ensure the insert is sitting flat in the tray.
4
Place growth medium in the farm. Place one sheet of the growth medium on top of the
microgreen insert. Make sure itʼs sitting flat on the insert.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
13
5
Spread the seeds over the growth medium. Gently open the seed baggie and sprinkle the
seeds evenly over the growth medium. Note that some microgreens require diﬀerent seed
densities, so you may receive more seeds for some varieties and fewer for others. Just be sure
to spread the seeds out as evenly as you can.
6
Place the QR code in front of the tray. Remove the QR tag from the seed baggie and place it in
the slot in front of the GrowServe tray.
7
Spray the seeds heavily with water. Use your water only spray bottle to heavily mist the seeds
and top of the growth medium. Really drench the seeds and growth medium —the wetter the
seeds and top of the growth medium, the better the seeds will germinate. Just be careful not to
spray too hard – you donʼt want the seeds to get swept away!
8
Place the humidity dome on top of the tray. Place the humidity dome over top of the newly
planted seeds. Remove it aȦer about a week, when the seeds have just begun to sprout.
9
Scan into the app. Open the Guided Growing app on your phone. From the home screen, tap
Scan Tag, then scan the QR on the crop tag as prompted and select Zone 5.
Planting is complete! The app will tell you when itʼs time to harvest your microgreens.
How To Transplant
Check out our tutorial video on how to transplant on the Learn tab of the app or by
scanning the QR code below:
As always, itʼs important to wear disposable gloves when working in the farm and wash your hands
beforehand.
This process will take 10-15 minutes.
Hereʼs how to transplant:
1
Remove the GrowServe trays from the farm (optional). Remove the GrowServe trays from
the farm for transplanting. Or, if itʼs easier for you, leave the trays in place inside the farm. It
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
14
can be simpler to leave the trays in the farm if transplanting to a lower zone because itʼs easy
to reach.
If removing the trays, youʼll first want to drain any water within before removing them from
the farm. Slowly liȦ up the front part of the tray and let the water drain out the back. Once
drained, remove each tray from the zone and place it on a sanitized table or cart.
3
Remove the pack of seedlings from the bottom zone. Gently remove the pack of
germinated seedlings from Zone five.
4
Transplant the seedlings. Gently remove each seedling and place it in its own grow site in
the tray. Dispose of the black tray that held the seedlings.
5
Carefully return the trays to the farm. If you removed the GrowServe trays from the farm
in step 2, slowly return them to their zone in the farm. Be very careful to place the trays back
in gently to avoid water spilling out of the zone.
6
Place the crop tag in the farm. Place the crop tag in the slot on the leȦ hand size of the
zone, behind the zone label.
7
Tap Transplant in the app. Now transplant in the Guided Growing app so youʼre alerted
later when itʼs time to harvest. Head to the homepage and tap on the crop youʼre
transplanting, then tap the Transplant button.
8
Clean the germination tray. Clean and sanitize the GrowServe tray in Zone 5 where the
seeds germinated:
●
Remove the GrowServe tray from the germination zone.
●
Run the tray, lid, and metal germination insert through a dishwasher, or clean by
hand:
○
Loosen debris with a scrub brush
○
Rinse debris
○
Scrub the tray, lid, and metal insert with dish soap
○
Rinse away soap
○
Spray with food-safe sanitizer
○
Allow a sanitizer contact time of five minutes
9
Clean the zone if needed. Inspect the zone before returning the tray to the farm. If thereʼs a
lot of algae in the zone, you may need to pause Autofarmer and wait 15 minutes for the trays
to drain before wiping down and sanitizing the zone.
10
Return the germination tray to the farm. Return the tray gently to avoid water splashing
from the zone.
Transplanting is complete! The app will let you know when itʼs time to harvest your crops.

How To Harvest & Clean
Check out our tutorial video on how to harvest and clean on the Learn tab of the app or
by scanning the QR code below:
Be sure to prevent water on the roots or in the trays from dripping on the edible portions of the plant.
As always, itʼs important to wear disposable gloves when working in the farm and wash your hands
beforehand.
This process will take 20-30 minutes.
Hereʼs how to Harvest:
1
Pause Autofarmer. Head to the homepage of the Guided Growing app and tap Pause
Autofarmer in the icon header. This will allow the trays to drain so you can wipe down the
zone aȦer harvesting.
2
Gear up. Wash your hands thoroughly, put on a pair of food safe disposable gloves, and
grab a sanitized pair of harvesting scissors.
3
Remove trays to a sanitized surface. Remove all four trays from the zone and place them
on a sanitized table or cart. Before removing, tilt the trays to the back of the farm to drain
the water within. This will help avoid dripping when you remove the trays.
4
Harvest! Each crop has a harvest window during which Babylon recommends harvesting.
The app will let you know when each cropʼs harvest window begins and ends.
Over this window, you can harvest the entire zone all at once, or you can complete
multiple partial harvests. Just be sure to fully harvest the crop at the end of the window
when the app says itʼs time for the final harvest.
Hereʼs how to harvest each type of crop:
For leafy greens, cut directly at the base of the plant. Harvest the entire plant and discard
the growth medium.
For herbs, find a cluster of leaves about a third of the way down the plant. Directly above
the cluster of leaves, cut the stem at a 45-degree angle. Come back to harvest again each
week until itʼs time to complete the cropʼs final harvest. Herbs like basil get pretty tall, so
keep them pruned and donʼt let them outgrow their space in the farm.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
16
For flowers, simply snip oﬀ at the stem. Youʼll want to prune the leaves as well by
trimming about a third of the way down the plant, cutting directly above clusters of leaves
on the plant. Keeping flower plants pruned encourages more flowers to grow and keeps
the zone looking tidy.
To harvest microgreens, snip at the base and dispose of the growth medium. If you
harvest only a portion of the sheet, be sure to cut away the harvested growth medium
before returning the rest of the microgreens to the farm.
5
Harvest the crop in the Guided Growing App. In the app, open the Home page, tap on
the crop, then tap the Harvest button. Youʼll be oﬀered an opportunity to share feedback.
Please do!
Since herbs and flowers can be harvested multiple times over their harvest window, thereʼs
no need to tap Harvest until you remove the crop from the farm entirely.
6
Clean the GrowServe Trays. This step is important, as it prevents buildup of algae in trays.
Algae buildup can impact farm performance, plus it doesnʼt look great.
1.
Remove algae & debris. Take the tray and lid to a sink. Discard the growth
medium, composting if available.
2.
Run the tray, lid, and metal insert through a dishwasher, or clean and sanitize
by hand. If cleaning by hand, take the tray and lid to a sink. Scrub away debris with
a scrub brush, rinse, then spray liberally with the food safe sanitizer. Using dish
soap when scrubbing can help remove debris on trays. If you use dish soap for this
step, be sure to rinse thoroughly with water to remove all soap residue. Once
rinsed, spray with the food safe sanitizer.
Repeat these steps for the remaining trays in the zone.
7
Clean the zone. Return to the farm and clean the zone, the area that houses the
GrowServe trays.
●
Remove the metal drain filter at the back of the zone. It may take some force to pop
it out of position – first liȦ the back of the insert, then pop out the piece by liȦing
from the front.
●
Using a disposable microfiber cloth, wipe away algae debris in the zone.
●
Spray the zone with the food safe sanitizer.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
17
●
Take the metal drain filter to a sink. Scrub away debris with the brush, then rinse.
Apply a small amount of dish soap and scrub. Rinse away the soap debris and
spray with the food-safe sanitizer. Allow a sanitizer contact time of five minutes.
●
Return the metal drain filter to the zone.
8
Carefully return the GrowServe trays to the farm. Carefully return your cleaned and
sanitized GrowServe trays to the farm.
9
Resume Autofarmer. Open the homepage of the app and tap the Resume Autofarmer
button.
GROWER TIP: Following planting notifications in the Guided Growing app will help ensure
you always have a pack ready for transplant when you harvest a zone.
Harvesting is complete! The zone is ready for more crops.
Further Detail on Harvesting
The Guided Growing App will let you know when itʼs time to begin harvesting. Each crop has a harvest
window during which Babylon recommends harvesting your crops.
You can harvest the entire zone all at once, or you can complete multiple partial harvests over the
window. Just be sure to fully harvest the crop at the end of the harvest window when the app says itʼs
time for the final harvest.
Harvest Windows
Leafy greens have a harvest window of two weeks, while herbs and flowers can be harvested multiple
times over the course of several weeks. Microgreens have a smaller harvest window since they have a
much shorter growth cycle.
Once your crops have reached the end of their recommended lifespan you will need to harvest all
remaining plants and clear the growing tier.
Read on for information on how to harvest each type of crop.
Harvesting Lettuce
Lettuce is harvested only once in order to maximize eﬀiciency in the Micro-Farm and to ensure a
higher-quality product. We recommend harvesting over a maximum two-week window (or all at once),
taking the plants that you need to use daily and disposing of the growth medium. Donʼt forget to
sanitize the zone. (see photograph opposite)
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
18
Harvesting Herbs & Flowers
Herbs and flowers take longer to mature, but once fully grown they allow multiple harvest cycles over
an extended period of time. With a pair of scissors, harvest the herbs and flowers. Cut the stem at a
45-degree angle, about an inch above a forked branch and the stem. Depending on where you cut, the
plants will take 7-14 days to grow back. When pruning, make sure to only take the top third of the
plant; if you remove too much, the plant may not be able to produce more. Be sure to prune the
plants, especially flowers, so that they donʼt get too large and grow into the lights and tier above.
Harvesting Microgreens
Harvest microgreens by snipping at the base of the plant. To reduce the risk of contamination, always
remove growth medium from harvested plants from the system. In other words, never harvest half a
sheet of microgreens and place the whole sheet back in the farm; be sure to cut away and dispose of
the growth medium from the harvested microgreens.
Disposal of Growth Media
Both growth media – in the seed packs and for the microgreens – are compostable. For more
information about the growth media, scan the QR codes below:
Growfoam (seed pack medium)
Hollandbio Jute Mats (microgreen medium)

How to Deep Clean Your Micro-Farm
(Complete Every 8 Weeks)
Check out our tutorial video on how to complete the deep clean on the Learn tab of the
app or by scanning the QR code below:
As always, itʼs important to wear disposable gloves when working in the farm and wash your hands
beforehand.
This process will take about an hour.
Hereʼs how to complete the Deep Clean:
1
Turn on Clean Mode. Open up the Guided Growing app and tap Maintenance, then Clean.
Toggle on Clean Mode as prompted. It will take about 20 minutes for the water in the zones to
drain into the reservoir below. While waiting, proceed to Step 2.
2
Clean the glass doors and sides of the farm. While the trays are draining, wipe down the
glass on the inside and outside of the farm with a disposable microfiber cloth.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
20
Do not use glass cleaner; instead, use a 50/50 mix of white distilled vinegar and water to clean
the glass. Apply only a small amount of the mixture to the cloth to buﬀ out any marks on the
glass. Take care to clean the glass on the outside of the farm, as well as inside where the
produce is growing.
3
Clean the downspouts at the back of each zone. Remove nutrient and plant debris from the
downspouts using a disposable microfiber cloth. Then apply sanitizer to a clean cloth and
wipe down the downspout tubing at the back of each zone.
4
Wipe down and sanitize Zone 5. Once the water has drained into the reservoir, youʼll want to
clean and sanitize the bottom zone (Zone 5) of your farm:
●
Remove the GrowServe trays to a sanitized surface. Itʼs ok if there are packs
germinating within the trays.
●
Remove the metal drain filter at the back of the zone. It may take some force to pop
out of position – first liȦ the back part of the insert, then pop out the piece by liȦing
from the front.
●
With a disposable microfiber cloth, wipe away algae and debris in the zone.
●
Spray the zone thoroughly with the food-safe sanitizer. Allow a sanitizer contact time
of five minutes.
●
In a sink, remove debris from the metal drain filter with the scrub brush, rinse, and
spray it with sanitizer. Then return it to the back of the zone.
●
Return the GrowServe trays to the zone.
5
Slide out the reservoir. Now back to the reservoir. Unlock the bottom panel of the farm.
Using the handles, slide out the reservoir drawer. Pull slowly to avoid sloshing.
6
Hook up the hose. Attach the hose to the farm and secure the other end in a sink or drain.
Important! Be sure the hose and hose coupling have the push-to-connect components, as
shown in the photo above. Connecting the hose without these components could cause a
leak.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
21
7
Toggle on the Drain Pump. In the app, toggle on the Drain Pump as prompted to begin
pumping water out of the reservoir.
8
Toggle oﬀ the Drain Pump. As soon as the water has drained, toggle oﬀ the Drain Pump. Turn
oﬀ the pump as soon as the water has drained to avoid damaging the pump.
9
Remove and store the hose. Now remove and store the hose. Take care to keep both ends of
the hose pointed upward until you can drain any remaining water before storing.
Be sure to remove via the push connect – donʼt unscrew the push connect from the hose.
Unscrewing the hose from the push connect or removing the push connect connector
altogether could cause a leak when your farm begins to irrigate later on.
10
Use the absorbent sponge to soak up remaining water in the reservoir. There will be a
small amount of water leȦ in the pump recess at the bottom of the reservoir. Soak up the
remaining water with the sponge, wringing it out in a bucket.
Dispose of the sponge aȦer use. Reusing the sponge in the farm is not recommended.
11
Scrub & remove debris from the reservoir. Use the scrub brush to loosen algae and debris,
then use a disposable microfiber cloth to remove it from the reservoir. Be sure to clean all
components within the reservoir, including the pumps and tubing, drainage mouth, and
sensor bracket:
Pictured above: pumps and tubing, sensor bracket liȦed upward for cleaning, drainage mouth.
Be careful not to jostle the components when cleaning, and take care not to allow water to
drip onto the leak detectors located in the nutrient bottle compartment. If you do, donʼt
worry, just dry it up and give us a call so we can keep your farm running as it should.
12
Sanitize the reservoir. Once all debris has been removed, spray all surfaces of the reservoir
with the food-safe sanitizer. Donʼt forget to apply sanitizer to the pumps, tubing, sensor
bracket, and drainage mouth as pictured in Step 11. Allow a sanitizer contact time of five
minutes.
13
Check the nutrient bottles. Nowʼs a good time to check to make sure the nutrient bottles in
your farm are full. If empty, replace with a bottle you have on hand and tap Exchange in the
app.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
22
14
Slide the reservoir back underneath. Gently slide the reservoir back underneath the frame
of the farm and lock the drawer.
15
Tap Fill & Dose. In the app, tap Fill & Dose. Your farm will begin to fill back up with water and
nutrients. This process can take up to a few hours – do not take the farm out of Fill & Dose
mode until complete. The farm will automatically put itself back in Autofarmer mode once
complete.
The Deep Clean is complete!

How to Complete the Peroxide Flush
We recommend performing a peroxide flush once every six months to clean the surfaces in your
farm that you can't reach, like the inside the downspout tubing and pumps.
Itʼs best to complete the flush when your farm is due for a reservoir clean, as it includes draining
and sanitizing the reservoir.
Follow the steps below, and let your Babylon account manager know if you have any questions.
This process takes about four hours.
How to perform a peroxide flush in your Micro-Farm
1.
Turn on Clean Mode. From the home page of the Guided Growing app, tap Maintenance,
then Clean. Turn on Clean Mode as prompted. If thereʼs water in the trays, it will take about
20 minutes for all the water to drain back into the reservoir.
2.
Remove the GrowServe trays and drainage filters from the Micro-Farm. While the water
is draining into the reservoir, put on a pair of disposable gloves. Remove all sixteen
GrowServe trays with crops and humidity domes from the farm and place on a sanitized
surface. Clean and sanitize the metal drain filters at the back of each zone, then set aside to
dry.
3.
Clean Zones 1-5. Once the water has drained into the reservoir, use the scrub brush to
loosen debris in each zone. Be sure to scrub on and around the downspouts as well as the
drainage mouth at the bottom of each tray. Use a disposable microfiber cloth to wipe away
the debris, then spray all surfaces with the food-safe sanitizer. Allow a sanitizer contact time
of five minutes.
4.
Return the metal drain filters to each zone. The drain filters should be cleaned and
sanitized from earlier.
5.
Clean the glass doors/sides of the farm. Proceed to Step 2 in the Clean page of the app. As
prompted, lightly spray a 50/50 mixture of water and distilled white vinegar on a disposable
microfiber cloth and buff out the marks on the glass. The sides and back of the farm inside
the growing area will be easier to access with the trays and crops removed.
6.
Slide out the reservoir and connect the hose. Skip ahead to Step 5 in the Clean page.
Slide out the reservoir and connect the hose as prompted.

7.
Pump out most of the water in the reservoir. Proceed to Step 6 in the app. As prompted,
turn on the Drain Pump. When there is about an inch of water leȦ in the reservoir, toggle oﬀ
the Drain Pump.
8.
Add soap to the reservoir and scrub. Add a small amount (about a teaspoon) of mild
detergent/dish soap to the reservoir. Using a scrub brush, scrub all surfaces and
components (including pumps, etc.) in the reservoir. Be careful not to jostle the pumps,
sensors, etc. in the reservoir.
9.
Pump out the soapy water. Back in the app (Step 6), toggle on the Drain Pump again to
pump out the soapy water.
10. Rinse and pump out the remaining soap. Using a cup or pitcher, pour water down the
sides of the reservoir to rinse away the soap residue, then pump it out with the Drain
Pump in the app (Step 6). Remove any remaining soap residue in the bottom of the
reservoir with an absorbent sponge.
11. Contact your account manager to add 20 gallons of water back into your farmʼs
reservoir. Do not use Fill & Dose for this step – you do not want to fill the reservoir all the
way up, nor add nutrients for this step. This could take 30 minutes to an hour – your
account manager will notify you when there is enough water in the reservoir to proceed to
the next step.
12. Add 48 ounces of 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide to the reservoir. Using gloves and
eye protection, carefully measure and pour 48 ounces of 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide
to the reservoir. We recommend this hydrogen peroxide solution, but any 3% solution will
work. Pour the peroxide in the reservoir carefully to avoid splashing.
13. Exit the Clean page to turn on the Irrigation Pump. From the Controls page in the app,
turn on the Irrigation Pump to begin circulating the peroxide and water throughout the
farm.
14. Set a timer for 1 hour. Allow the irrigation pumps to run the peroxide solution throughout
the system for at least an hour.
15. Toggle oﬀ the irrigation pump. Head to the Controls page of the app to turn oﬀ the
irrigation pump.
16. Wait 20-30 minutes for all the water in the trays to drain into the reservoir.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
25
17. Pump the peroxide solution out of the reservoir. Once all the water has drained back into
the reservoir, head back to Step 6 in the Clean page to toggle on the Drain Pump once
more. Toggle oﬀ the drain pump once the water has drained.
18. Tap Fill & Dose. Proceed to Step 11 in the app. As prompted, toggle on Fill & Dose. Your
reservoir will begin to fill back up with water and nutrients. This process can take up to two
hours – the farm will automatically go back into Autofarmer mode when the fill and dose is
complete.
19. Return the clean GrowServe trays, lids, germination inserts, and humidity domes to
the farm.
20. Close and lock the doors to the growing area. Be sure to lock the reservoir drawer as well.
The peroxide flush is complete!

https://resources.babylonmicrofarms.com/troubleshooting or by scanning the QR code below:
Here are some common FAQs:
●
Why isnʼt there any water in my farmʼs trays?
○
Your farm irrigates at intervals throughout the day, so there wonʼt always be water in
the trays. That said, contact your account manager if your plants look wilted.
●
What do I do if my farm is leaking?
○
Immediately hit the red Emergency Stop button located in the bottom reservoir area of
your farm, or unplug the farm.
○
Find the origin of the leak and call your customer service representative.
●
Why is my farm oﬀline?
○
Your Micro-Farm may occasionally lose connection from the cellular router and need to
be reset. Youʼll know your farm is oﬀline if a “Farm oﬀline” banner is displayed at the
top of your home screen in the Guided Growing app.
○
To reset your farm, simply unplug it from the outlet in the wall behind the farm, wait 10
seconds, then plug the farm back in. If the farm has not come back online in five
minutes, contact your account manager.
●
Why is my app unresponsive or displaying an error message?
○
First, close and reopen your app and check to make you have the most updated
version of the app downloaded on your phone.
○
If your app continues to have the issue, email us at support@babylonmicrofarms.com.

Safety and Warnings
Authorized Access & Personnel Only
Keep the Micro-Farm doors and bottom panel closed at all times when not attending to the farm. We
recommend locking the doors and bottom panel to prevent unauthorized access. Only allow trained
Babylon personnel (Babylon employees, approved farm service technicians) to access the electrical
components of the Micro-Farm to avoid the risk of shock.
Children & Unauthorized Personnel
Babylon Micro-Farms are not toys and should only be operated by trained adults. Closely supervise
children and other unauthorized personnel near the farm.
Pets
Do not allow pets near or in the farm. The nutrient-rich water in the reservoir and trays may be
damaging to their health if consumed.
Nutrients and pH Solutions
The two (2) nutrient solutions and one (1) pH solution liquids delivered in three separate, sealed jugs
should be handled with care. You may wish to wear gloves and eye protection when handling nutrients
and pH solutions. Do not drink the pH or nutrient solutions and rinse skin and eyes with cold water

28
immediately if exposed to any of the solutions. SDS sheets for these materials can be found in the back
portion of your User Manual.
Growth Medium
The SDS sheet for the growth medium can be found in the back of this user guide.
Disposal of Reservoir Liquids
The water reservoir at the bottom of the Micro-Farm contains nutrient-rich water that should only be
disposed of in a sewer with waste water management and treatment. Do not dispose of reservoir
liquids in open water such as ponds, rivers, or streams; this can lead to eutrophication of waterways.
LED Lights
The LED grow lights are bright, so avoid looking directly into them. The lights can become very warm
or even hot to the touch and may cause burns.
Avoid Micro-Farm Tipping
Your Micro-Farm will be levelled on its four feet when installed. Ensure that the Micro-Farm remains
level throughout its time at your facility. The Micro-Farm can be secured to a wall or ceiling for extra
tip-over protection. Do not climb, stand, or hang on or from the diﬀerent levels of the Micro-Farm. The
shelves are not designed to hold a personʼs weight. Instead, use the provided step ladder for accessing
upper farm tiers. Leaning on or hanging from the Micro-Farm or any of its shelves could cause it to
break or tip over, causing serious injury or death.
Use of Permitted Materials Only
Babylon Micro-Farms are carefully designed and tested for the specific seeds, crops, growth medium,
nutrient components, and pH balancer. Use of any other materials not provided by Babylon is
prohibited and could cause farm contamination, unsafe produce, and/or hazards to those working
around the farm and eating the produce grown within. Babylon is not responsible for any damage to
the Micro-Farm or other property; any damage to the growing produce; or any injury to persons which
result from the use of unauthorized materials, supplies, seeds, or plantings.

Incorporating your Micro-Farm into your food safety
plan
Babylon recommends including your Micro-Farm and farming practices in your HACCP plan or other
food safety plan. The following sections contain information and resources to help you do so.
Product Description
A Babylon Micro-Farm is a modular vertical hydroponic growing unit that allows its users to grow
leafy greens, herbs, microgreens and edible flowers indoors year round. Users need only to plant,
transplant, harvest and clean their units. Nutrient management and crop growth actions are all
handled remotely by Babylon. The farm is connected to a cold, potable water source and
automatically adds water to the system each day.
Babylon sells the growing units to customers and provides all consumables needed to grow. This
includes pre packaged seed packs with corresponding QR crop tags, growth media, nutrient & pH
balancing solutions, and cleaning & harvesting tools. Babylon handles seeds and growth media
using best safety practices and implements safety protocols to prevent contamination. Some of
these safety practices include providing safe, clean, and dry storage for growth media and seeds;
wearing sterile gloves when handling seeds and seed packs; regularly cleaning seeding areas; and
lot tracking seeds for traceability.
Farm operators (customers) are responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of their Micro-Farm.
This includes planting, transplanting, and harvesting crops on time as specified by the Guided
Growing app, as well as cleaning.
Biological, Physical & Chemical Hazards
This section contains information about the types of hazards to be aware of and to be included in
your new or preexisting HACCP plan.
Implementing safe food handling practices on site and into your HACCP plan can help reduce risk
associated with physical, biological, and chemical hazards associated with growing and harvesting
your own produce on-site.
Biological Hazards
Biological hazards include bacteria and viruses that contaminate food and cause illness. These
pathogens include salmonella and E. coli, and can be transmitted by people, animals, or water.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
32
Adhering to Babylonʼs recommended cleaning guidelines minimizes the risk of biological hazards.
Some of these hazards include:
●
Transfer of microbes from operator to crop because of improper handling (human to plant)
●
Growth of/contamination by microbes due to improper handling/transport of material
●
Growth of/contamination by pests from improper produce storage
●
Growth of microbes resulting from dirty farm or improper cleaning
●
Growth of microbes due to lack of cleaning and proliferation of algae/biofilms
●
Growth of pest insects because of proliferation of algae/biofilms
●
Growth of microbes resulting from lack of water change & cleaning (resulting from lack of
reservoir and tray cleaning)
●
Growth of microbes resulting from crop death
●
Contamination from microbes because of poor post-harvest produce storage
●
Exposure to pathogens from water supply*
* Babylon oȦen tests source water at the time of install. This is only to test for
a common suite of minerals and nutrients related to plant growth, not pathogens.
Chemical hazards
Chemical hazards include cleaning chemicals, pesticides, oil, medications, and fuel products.
Ensuring the Micro-Farmʼs water source is free of these contaminants is an important first step in
mitigating chemical hazards. Furthermore, using only the food-safe, peroxide-based cleaning
agents recommended and supplied by Babylon will help mitigate risk of chemical exposure.
Some of these chemical hazards include:
●
Water source contamination (exposure to toxins or heavy metals from water supply)
●
Dripping or transfer of agricultural water / improper handling and produce washing
●
Contamination by use of non-approved chemicals in the Micro-Farm
●
Presence of /storage of leȦover cleaning chemicals, nutrient solutions, and sensor
calibration solutions
Physical Hazards
Physical hazards include non-food objects that could cause illness if consumed, such as metal,
glass, wood, and hard plastic fragments.
Physical hazard risk can be mitigated by keeping both the doors to the growing area and the
reservoir drawer closed and locked. Micro-Farm should be in an area free of debris from
construction, so take appropriate steps to deactivate and cover a Micro-Farm during construction,
or move out of the construction zone.
Some of these physical hazards include:

There are several steps you can take to minimize risk from the biological, chemical, and physical
hazards discussed above, including:
●
Following cleaning and sanitizing procedures as recommended by Babylon (see section
below for more detail on cleaning protocols)
●
Restricting farm access to trained, authorized individuals.
●
Ensuring the Micro-Farm is installed in an environment free of hazards (Ex. ensuring the site
has clean air and no debris from construction, etc.)
●
Preventing irrigation water from dripping on roots and in the trays from dripping on edible
portions of the plant during harvesting.
●
Filling Water Only spray bottle for spritzing seeds with clean, potable water only.
●
Storing all seed packs, growth material, and farm supplies in a clean, dry area. Take special
care to store seed packs and growth material away from hazards, as these will be placed
inside the water within the system.
●
Implementing a food-safe pest management service further helps to reduce risk of
biological hazards.
●
Following good food hygiene practices (abstaining from farm operation if you are feeling
unwell, covering cuts with bandages, etc.)
●
Testing the Micro-Farmʼs water source to ensure potability and absence of chemicals,
bacteria, etc.
●
Prohibiting pets and other animals in or around the farm.
●
Closing and locking reservoir drawer and doors to growing area when the farm is not in use
●
Maintaining ambient temperature between 67°F and 76°F in area where Micro-Farm is
located.
●
Maintaining relative humidity between 30% and 60% in area where Micro-Farm is located
●
Contacting Babylon at support@babylonmicrofarms.com if you encounter any unusual
hazard issues in your farm, such as the occurrence of pests in the Micro-Farm or
contamination of water supply.
Expanding your HACCP or other food safety plan to include Micro-Farm operations can be a further
step in minimizing hazard risk. See subsequent section on Biological, chemical & physical
hazards for more information on how to include your Micro-Farm in your HACCP or other food
safety plan.
Further detail on cleaning protocols
Cleaning and sanitizing your Micro-Farm in accordance with Babylon guidelines is important to
minimizing food safety risk. Cleaning guidelines are outlined in the Micro-Farm User Guide & how-to
videos accessible through the Guided Growing app.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
38
The following practices, as outlined in Babylon support materials, are essential to maintaining a
safe growing environment in your Micro-Farm:
●
Clean & sanitize GrowServe trays and tray components immediately following each
transplant step. This includes the germination tray, germination insert or tray, and
humidity dome.
●
Clean & sanitize GrowServe trays, tray components, and the entire zone immediately
following each final harvest. All crops should be removed from the zone.
●
Deep clean the growing area and reservoir at least every eight weeks. In addition to
draining, sanitizing, and refilling the reservoir, the Deep Clean includes cleaning the food
contact surfaces in the growing area: glass sides and doors, downspout tubing, drainage
basins at the back of each zone, and the air column (specific to V6 model).
●
Complete a Peroxide flush of the Micro-Farm at least once every six months. The
peroxide flush should be performed every six months to clean the surfaces in your farm that
you canʼt reach, like inside the downspout tubing and irrigation pumps. This procedure
should also be performed in the case of any suspected contamination events.
●
Remove expired or dead plant material from the Micro-Farm. Be sure to remove any
dead crop material in the case of a crop failure. Crops should always be transplanted and
harvested in accordance with Guided Growing app recommendations (i.e. transplant and
harvest window notifications) and should not be leȦ in the farm past the final harvest date.
Do not plant ungerminated plant pods into the growing trays in Zones 1-4.
●
Follow CDC guidelines and all other local regulations for produce washing. Babylon
continues to advocate to follow CDC guidelines which recommends washing produce prior
to consumption. See https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/
communication/steps-healthy-fruits-veggies.html for more information.
Farming inputs
Babylon sources Micro-Farming inputs from trusted third parties and implements several safety
protocols on-site at Babylon’s headquarters to ensure farming inputs are safe for Babylon
clients.
The following sections include further detail on Micro-Farming inputs.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
39
Seeds
Babylon sources seeds from accredited third party companies only, primarily Johnnyʼs Selected Seeds
headquartered in Maine, U.S.A. A few varieties are occasionally sourced from other companies.
All Babylon-sourced seeds are GMO-free, and seed lots are traceable upon request. Visit
babylonmicrofarms.com/JohnnysSeedsQualityInfo for more information.
Growth Medium
Babylon supplies two primary types of growth medium:
1.
GrowFoam for seed packs. GrowFoam is an inert, hydroponic growth medium made of
biodegradable biopolymers. It is commercially compostable and tested regularly for the
presence of E. coli and listeria and is checked for total colony count. For more information on

To view safety data sheets for Babylonʼs cleaning agents and growth media, visit
babylonmicrofarms.com/SDS.
Cleaning Agents
Regular cleaning with approved cleaning agents is essential to Micro-Farm performance and ensuring
a food safe environment in the system.
The following agents are recommended for use in the Micro-Farm:
1.
SaniDate RTU. SaniDate RTU is the recommended sanitizer for cleaning food contact surfaces
in the Micro-Farm, including:
●
GrowServe trays and zones underneath following each final crop harvest
●
Downspouts and basin areas at the back of each zone following each final harvest
●
Drain filters at the back of each zone following each final harvest
●
The reservoir area during the Deep Clean every eight weeks
●
Net cups aȦer each harvest (V6 model only)
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
40
SaniDate RTU is a ready-to-use, peroxide-based sanitizer that does not require rinsing aȦer
application.
2.
3% Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide. Babylon recommends Essential Oxygenʼs 3% Food Grade
Hydrogen Peroxide Solution for use during the semi-annual Peroxide flush. The food grade
peroxide is added to fresh water in the reservoir aȦer draining and cleaning the system, then is
flushed throughout to clean downspout tubing, pump interiors, and other equipment that
cannot be accessed easily with SaniDate RTU.
Crop Types & Growth Times
Babylon supports the growth of microgreens, leafy greens, herbs, and flowers. Each crop type has a
specific growth time and harvest window, which is the interval of time Babylon recommends
harvesting each crop.
It is important to follow the transplant and final harvest dates as listed in the Guided Growing app for
best results. The following sections below contain more information on each crop type Babylon
supports.
Leafy greens
Babylon oﬀers a number of leafy greens and leafy green mixes. Leafy greens include leaf lettuce
varieties such as romaine, as well as heartier varieties like kale and mustard greens.
All leafy greens have a recommended total grow time of six weeks. The harvest window for leafy
greens is seven days and begins a week before the final harvest/removal date. This means Babylon
recommends harvesting leafy greens five to six weeks following planting the seed pack.
Leafy greens vs. baby or petite greens
Baby or petite greens are leafy greens that are harvested ~3-4 weeks aȦer germination. They are
distinct from both microgreens and adult greens. Petite greens are harvested before they reach
maturity and tend to be more tender than their adult leafy green counterparts. Babylon does not
currently support production of baby greens in the Micro-Farm at this time.
Herbs
Babylon oﬀers a variety of herbs and herb mixes. Herbs are slower-growing, stay in the farm longer
than leafy greens, and have an extended harvest window of several weeks. Herbs are ready for their
first harvest at week 5 or 6, and have a total growth time of 11-12 weeks, depending on the variety.
Babylon customers are advised to complete multiple harvests throughout the harvest window, on a
weekly or bi-weekly cadence. For this reason, Babylon refers to herbs as “cut-and-come-again” crops.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
41
All herbs and growth medium should be completely removed from the farm by the final harvest date,
and trays should be removed and cleaned before receiving the next round of crops.
Harvesting regularly during the herb harvest window helps increase the total yield of the crop and
provides the customer with a consistent supply. Additionally, regular harvesting prevents herbs from
overcrowding the zone; crop overcrowding can lead to poor circulation in the system and light
deficiency.
Flowers
Babylon currently oﬀers a few varieties of flowers to grow in the Micro-Farm. Like herbs, flowers have
an extended growth time and harvest window and are in the farm for a total of 18 weeks. The plants do
not usually produce flowers for the first harvest until week 10.
Also like herbs, flowers are a “cut-and-come-again” crop, meaning they should be harvested regularly
throughout the harvest window. Regular pruning of the leaves on each plant during the harvest
window is also key; regular pruning promotes flower production and prevents the plants from
overcrowding the zone.
Microgreens
Microgreens are young, nutrient-dense shoots known for their high nutrient content and culinary
versatility. They are the first leaves to appear from germinating seeds and are harvested 12-14 days
aȦer planting as recommended by Babylon.
Microgreens are grown in the bottom zone of the Micro-Farm on a single 10inx20in sheet of growth
medium. They are not transplanted like all other crops in the farm. Microgreens are harvested by
snipping the stems at least two centimeters above the growth medium.
Microgreens vs. Sprouts
Microgreens are oȦen conflated with, but are distinct from, sprouts for a number of reasons. Babylon
does not support sprout cultivation in the Micro-Farm.
Sprouts are grown in a moist, oȦen dark environment for seven days or less. As such, they are more
prone to microbial contamination and pose a higher food safety risk. The roots of sprouts are usually
leȦ intact as an edible portion of the plant, further increasing the risk of potential microbial
contamination from agricultural irrigation on the roots.
Microgreens are distinct from sprouts for a few reasons. They are grown in a lit, well-ventilated area
and are harvested without their roots. They are also harvested later than sprouts, 12-14 days aȦer
planting as recommended by Babylon. This means microgreens have a much lower food safety risk
than sprouts. Like other types of crops like leafy greens, the greatest food safety risk is from improper
handling and/or washing of the produce following harvest.
© Babylon Micro-Farms 2023 | 877.589.2885 | support@babylonmicrofarms.com
42
Due to the increased food safety risk, Babylon does not support or condone sprout production in
the Micro-Farm.
Cutting microgreens at least two centimeters above the root zone is recommended to further avoid
contamination by agricultural irrigation water in the root area.
The diﬀerences between microgreens & sprouts are further explained below:
The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) specifically outlines the key diﬀerence between sprouts and
microgreens. FSMA defines sprouts as “usually harvested when the cotyledons (or seed leaves) are still
un- or under-developed and true leaves have not begun to emerge”, while “microgreens reach a later
stage of growth, typically associated with the emergence of ʻtrueʼ leaves” (page 74497, Comment 363.)
Because Babylon does not support the growth of sprouts and recommends harvesting microgreens
without their roots, microgreens grown in Babylon farms are not subject to special produce handling
instructions as outlined in Subpart M of 21 CFR Part 112.
